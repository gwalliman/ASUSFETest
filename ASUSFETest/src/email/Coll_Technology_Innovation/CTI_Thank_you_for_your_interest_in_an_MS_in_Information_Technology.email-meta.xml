Thank you for your interest in the Master of Science in information technology. The program prepares graduates for leadership roles in conceptualizing, organizing and realizing information technology projects. Program course work encompasses core technologies plus a focus area and an applied project.

This program is designed to be a year-long project experience in which student teams work with an external customer on an authentic, practice-based problem related to information technology. Students are expected to complete the degree within one year.


Focus areas include:
-web
-security
-network administration
-video games with a secondary focus in a related area

The Master of Science in information technology requires 33 credit hours including the required applied project course.

Admission Information

Consideration is given to students who have an appropriate technical, science or business baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university, and who possess course work in statistics and technical writing. Applicants must also submit a GRE score, and international applicants must meet university TOEFL standards. The applicantâ€™s past work and professional experience are also evaluated and taken into consideration. Industrial experience beyond completion of a baccalaureate degree is strongly recommended.

I hope this information proves useful to you as you consider degree programs. If you are ready to apply, I encourage you to start your application today.


Sincerely,
