    <subject>Salesforce System Outage - Monday, Dec. 2nd</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello Salesforce Users!

We will be migrating some new functionality into Salesforce. We will be disconnecting your access on Monday, December 2nd at 4:30 PM. We anticipate the outage to last approximately two hours. Should you have any difficulties logging into Salesforce after 6:30 PM, please let me know. This new functionality should not impact any of your current processes, procedures, or access. Please feel free to contact me regarding this outage or anything else.

Thanks,
