    <textOnly>Hello Salesforce Recruitment Users!

Thank you so much for your patience. We have completed the migration of new data and functionality. I apologize for the delay, but I hope that it will make some of the data entry a little easier. Please be sure to review the documentation provided for this new functionality. It is posted in the Graduate Recruitment User Group. I encourage you to attend a training session this week. As a reminder, these sessions are for current Salesforce Graduate Recruitment users who will be entering data. Please reply to the training message to Chatter for the session you would like to attend. There will be additional sessions as needed.

Thank you again for your patience. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Helen Lueck,  MSISE
