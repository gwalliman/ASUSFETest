Thank you for your interest in the Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Arizona State University! I look forward to assisting you as you consider your options at ASU.


About the Program

The primary objective of the graduate program in Human Nutrition is to provide advanced training in the research methodologies and biochemical laboratory skills that are relevant to nutrition. Graduate students are expected to develop competencies in research methods and in advanced practice knowledge relevant to their area of study. The skills and knowledge acquired during the course of training should enable each student to develop professional competencies that can be applied to significant problems and issues within the field of nutrition and dietetics.


The MS degree is aimed at two categories of students:


Students who want to become Registered Dietitians with the MS degree:
The majority of applicants to the ASU MS in Human Nutrition program plan on finishing the combined two year MS degree plus Dietetic Internship, then complete the RD exam. Students must have completed an accredited Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) and apply to the ASU Dietetic Internship at the same time.

Students who want to complete an MS degree in Nutrition only, without the RD credential:
Less than 10% of students who wish to complete this MS degree without the dietetic internship are admitted each year â€“ usually in order to go on to a PhD program or apply to medical school. It is recommended that students have undergraduate degrees in nutrition or science. Students can complete only the MS degree without the dietetic internship in approximately one year depending upon successful completion of their research thesis.

About Admission

We seek applicants with strong GRE scores on all portions of the exam. However, there are no minimum scores for the GRE examination, which is evaluated in the context of your entire application package.


We accept applications for fall only with a deadline of Feb. 15.


Please let me know if you have any questions and thank you so much for your interest!
