About the Program

The Nutrition programs now offer a Master of Science (MS) in Nutrition with a concentration in dietetics. This degree is a non-thesis option for Registered Dietitians (RDs) seeking to continue their education, advance their skills as practitioners, and achieve their career goals.



Designed with working professionals in mind, dietetics-concentration courses will be offered one evening a week either in-person or online, and students can enroll part or full-time.



The MS in Nutrition, Dietetics Concentration is based on the scientific foundations of nutrition and prepares students to have strong writing skills, computer literacy, interpretive expertise, and problem-solving skills. Students will be required to complete 30 credits, including six credits of an applied project that focuses on the practice and science of dietetics.



Applicants to the MS in Nutrition, Dietetics Concentration must have one year, full-time work experience as an RD; however, applicants will not have to be employed at the time they apply to the program, nor will students have to be employed to maintain in good standing with the program.
