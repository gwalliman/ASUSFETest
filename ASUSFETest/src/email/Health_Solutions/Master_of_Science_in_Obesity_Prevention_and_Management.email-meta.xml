Thank you for your interest in the Master of Science in Obesity Prevention and Management at Arizona State University! I look forward to assisting you as you consider your options at ASU.


About the Program

The Master of Science in Obesity Prevention and Management is an innovative, interdisciplinary degree program that draws on a wide array of expertise at ASU to integrate perspectives from the social, applied, life, and health sciences and provides advanced graduate level problem-focused, experiential training that is grounded in evidence and best practices for effective prevention and management of obesity. This degree is geared towards post-baccalaureate students and professionals who wish to advance their understanding of social, cultural, environmental, health, and psychological issues associated with obesity. The program emphasizes the complex etiology of obesity and includes courses that will enhance students’ ability to work with individuals and populations at risk of obesity to develop effective strategies for prevention and management of the condition across the lifespan.


About the Tracks

The primary objective of this graduate program is to help prepare a workforce that understands the multifaceted nature of the obesity problem and is trained to develop effective solutions at the individual and population levels.   This degree offers four different tracks which provide each student with the ability to tailor his/her program of study to meet individual professional goals.  These tracks are: Public Health Approaches for Behavior Change, Cultural Aspects of Behavior Change, Technological Approaches to Behavior Change and “General”.


All students will take a 3 credit core course in Introduction to Obesity Prevention and Management.  As part of the electives (21 credits), students will choose from a set of courses as follows: Research Methods (3 credits), Statistics (3 credits), Concepts in Behavior Change (3 credits), 2 3-credit courses in their chosen track, and 2 additional 3-credit electives. In addition, all students will complete a 6-credit capstone project where under the guidance of a faculty mentor, they will be designing and/or implementing an intervention for obesity prevention or management for a specific organization, group, or community.


About Admission to the Program

We seek applicants with strong GRE scores on all portions of the exam. However, there are no minimum scores for the GRE examination, which are evaluated in the context of your entire application package. Students should have taken undergraduate level courses in statistics and psychology and ideally have completed one or more courses in nutrition, physiology, and chemistry.


We are currently accepting applications for fall 2014 with a deadline of June 1.


Please let me know if you have any questions and thank you so much for your interest!
